            <h2>Overwatch 2:</h2>
            <p class="text">Overwatch 2 is a 5v5 “Hero Shooter”, full of different playable characters, each with their own unique abilities, mechanics, etc. Each team can
                 only have one of each hero active at any given time. Competitive Overwatch 2 games are played across four different modes: Hybrid (Combination of Assault 
                 and Escort.  Attacking team must first battle the defenders to win control of an objective point where a payload sits. Once the point is taken, the payload
                 becomes activated, and attackers must escort it to the delivery point at the other end of the map.), Control (Both teams fight to capture a single objective),
                 Escort (Attackers escort a payload while defenders try to stop their progress), Push (teams fight over control of a robot in an effort to escort it as it pushes
                 your team’s barricade to the delivery point.).  Each game mode ends when Attackers accomplish their objective OR Defenders hold off until the game timer reaches 
                 zero.  Also, each hero has unique weapons and abilities suited for various situations.  Heroes are separated into three distinct categories: Damage heroes seek 
                 out to engage and defeat opponents using their various tools and abilities. It is the duty of a damage hero to secure eliminations, Support players empower their
                 allies by healing, boosting damage, or providing vital utility. These heroes are essential to a team’s survival,Tanks soak up damage, create space for the team, 
                 and break apart fortified positions. Heroes in the tank category will lead the charge.  Along with each hero comes multiple abilities. These are defined in three
                 ways: Active (needs to cool down between uses. Average 2 per hero), Passive (unique, inherent abilities/perks that do not need to be activated),Ultimate (powerful
                 abilities; charge them by healing allies or dealing damage). </p>
